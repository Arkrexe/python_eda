1. Dataset Shape
1000 rows and 8 columns.

2. Missing Values
No missing values found.

3. Descriptive Statistics
- Scores range between 0 and 100.
- Math score shows moderate variation.

4. Outlier Detection
IQR method used.
Few extreme values detected in math and reading scores.
Outliers were capped instead of removed to avoid data loss.

5. Correlation Insights
- Math, Reading, and Writing scores are highly positively correlated.
- Strong relationship between Reading and Writing scores.

6. Conclusion
Dataset is clean.
Outliers handled using IQR capping.
Ready for further modeling.
